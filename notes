features:

static analysis:
  - strings
  - elf section/program headers
  - disassembly??
  - fuzzy hash
  - sha256, md5 hashes
  - upx unpacking??

dynamic analysis:
  - support for multiple architectures (via buildroot/qemu)
    - vm comes with gdb/gdbserver for debugging if required
  - network simulation and packet capture (inetsim/dumpcap)
  - filesystem tracking (inotifywatch)
  - system call tracing (strace -ff)
  - library call tracing if sample is dynamically linked (ltrace -f)
  - direct vm access for user (ssh|pipe) if invoked
  - direct qemu monitor access if invoked

memory analysis:
  - system memory dump (volatility)
  - core dump??

result presentation:
  - domains/ips and ports accessed
  - filesystem changes
  - yara rule matching
  - support for virustotal API

dynamic analysis infrastructure:
  - orchestration within vm coordinated by python script (subprocess)
  - shell scripts set up and reset fakeroot environment
  - files transferred to and from vm via ftp (pure-ftpd) (ssh/scp can be killed by malware)
  - communication with vm done by pipe/stdio

todo:
  - set up logging
  - better error handling, more informative
  - create makefile for testing
  - test vm scripts
  - implement fuzzy hashing
